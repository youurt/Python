Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.\n",

Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the files to a different location on your system, and make sure the code in the except block executes properly.\n",

Download the text files for these works, or copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your computer. You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word or phrase appears in a string. For example, the following code counts the number of times 'row' appears in a string:\n",
    "    * line = \"Row, row, row your boat\" \n",
